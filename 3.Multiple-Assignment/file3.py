# name = "Achal"
# age = 27
# attractive = True

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)

# Above code is lenthy, Here Multiple Assignment Comes in the Picture.

# name, age, attractive = "Achal", 27, True

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)


# Another Example 
# What do you do when it will look like this -
# a = 30
# b = 30
# c = 30
# d = 30

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(d)

# Using Multiple Assignment
# a = b = c = d = 30

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(d)
